# Investigate-a-dataset
Udacity Data Analysis second course project

In this project, we wrangle and explore a dataset to derive conclusions based on it. The dataset used is TMDb movie data (cleaned from
original data on https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata), which contains information
about 10,000 movies. 

The questions we explore are:
1. On which month are most movies released?
2. Is the profit of a movie affected by the month it was released on?
4. Are there genres that make a movie produce higher profit than others?


This project uses the pandas DataFrame and matplotlib for the visualizations.
